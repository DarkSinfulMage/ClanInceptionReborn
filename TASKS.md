Last update: 10 November 2018

ISSUES: 

- Going to the save screen and back will sometimes prevent screens and information from displaying. 
- Sex scenes and birthing will sometimes display code instead of text. 
- In Submissive mode - Thoth taking their turn will display incorrect line when they are supposed to transform.
- While Pregnant - Thoth will say the same line about her pregnancy.

CURRENT FOCUS:

- Refactor and organize functions for clarity and structure
- Document project for clarity and collaberation

TODO:

- Futanari support. Several parts of the game have trouble with Futa x Futa and Female(player) x Futa actions.
- Dysphoria balance. The game currently his you a bit too hard with only content for Thoth.
- Import more modern version of avatar drawing system. It's a bit lost but was improved long after CI was out. The new version should be 	integrated into the game. 

LACKING FEATURES: 

- There is currently no benefit to successfully having children. The game is about breeding a new clan. Since the game deals in weeks, 
	perhaps we can work in a timescale to have them become useful to the player after some amount of (N*56) weeks.
- Thoth as Leader - perhaps the submissive condition should be a whole separate way to play without loss condition. Perhaps looking at the two 	loss conditions in general is a good idea.
- Anhk having your children should have some benefit.

DESIRED FEATURES:

- Some content should be linked to having used Red/white/green nuts.
- Supporting Thoth should work when they are a dominant female, male, and futa.
